## General Decision Making

The CF adopts the Lazy Consensus model, as defined by the [Apache Foundation](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html), combined with [Martha's Rules](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&context=sociologyfacpub) adapted for our context. This hybrid approach ensures inclusivity and efficiency in decision-making across time zones.

### Expectations for Consensus Decision Making

Consensus is about finding a workable compromise:
- Dissent should be voiced early for constructive discussion.
- Every member, irrespective of role, is entitled to an equal voice and vote.

## Proposal Development and Review Process

Proposals begin as GitHub Discussions to encourage collaborative refinement.

### Reviews

For a proposal ready for review:

1. **Review Discussion Creation:**
   - Transition from the initial discussion to a Review discussion, outlining the proposal in detail.

2. **Sense Vote:**
   - Community feedback is gauged through reactions (👍, 👀, 👎). For nuanced feedback, a scale like 🚀 😄 👀 😕 👎 may be used.

3. **Determination Steps:**
   - **Broad Support:** Move to the next stage ([final vote if needed](#proposals-requiring-a-vote)) if most are in favor or neutral.
   - **Broad Discomfort:** Rework by the sponsor if there are significant objections.
   - **Mixed Responses:** Sponsor addresses concerns; unresolved issues lead to a meeting.

#### Handling Unresolved Issues

If asynchronous consensus is not reached:

- Schedule a meeting to discuss further, ensuring all relevant parties can attend.
- The sponsor and objectors present their views.
- Facilitate a structured 10-minute discussion on objections.
- Conclude with a vote: "Should we proceed despite objections if the majority feels the proposal is workable?"
- A majority 'yes' implements the decision; a 'no' requires rework.

Record occurrence and outcome of the meeting in the Discussion.

#### Proposals Requiring a Vote

- Proposals related to matters requiring a [CF Council Supermajority Vote](3-cf-council.md#matters-requiring-supermajority-vote).

## Elections

CF uses a preference-based voting system through [Elekto](https://elekto.dev/docs/), allowing for ranked-choice voting.
